# Array and Matrix Operations

## Description
--------------
In this assignment, we will perform various operations on one-dimensional arrays (vectors) and two-dimensional arrays (matrices) using the NumPy library in Python.

Below is the list of operations that will be performed in the Jupyter Notebook file (Hw1.ipynb).

## List of Operations
---------------------
- Create a one-dimensional array (vector) with the first 10 positive integers and display its value.
- Create a two-dimensional array (matrix) with a size of 3x3, fill it with zeros, and display its value.
- Create an array with a size of 5x5, fill it with random integers from 1 to 10, and display its value.
- Create a 4x4 array, fill it with random real numbers from 0 to 1, and display its value.
- Create two one-dimensional arrays of size 5, fill them with random integers from 1 to 10, and perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations on them.
- Create two vectors of size 7, fill them with random numbers, and find their dot product.
- Multiply two matrices of sizes 2x2 and 2x3, filled with random integers from 1 to 10.
- Find the inverse of a 3x3 matrix filled with random integers from 1 to 10.
- Transpose a 4x4 matrix filled with random real numbers from 0 to 1.
- Multiply a 3x4 matrix by a vector of size 4, filled with random integers from 1 to 10.
- Multiply a 2x3 matrix by a vector of size 3, filled with random real numbers from 0 to 1.
- Perform element-wise multiplication of two 2x2 matrices filled with random integers from 1 to 10.
- Find the product of two 2x2 matrices filled with random integers from 1 to 10.
- Find the sum of elements of a 5x5 matrix filled with random integers from 1 to 100.
- Find the difference between two 4x4 matrices filled with random integers from 1 to 10.
- Find a column vector containing the sum of elements of each row of a 3x3 matrix filled with random real numbers from 0 to 1.
- Create a matrix with squares of numbers from a 3x4 matrix with arbitrary integers.
- Find a vector of square roots from a vector of size 4 filled with random integers from 1 to 50.
